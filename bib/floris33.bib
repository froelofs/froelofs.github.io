multi-context systems. First, we establish a satisfiability algorithm
based on an encoding into propositional logic. Then, we propose a
distributed decision procedure that maximally exploits the potential
amenity of localizing reasoning and restricting it to relevant contexts.
We show that the latter approach is computationally superior to our
translation-based procedure, and outline how off-the-shelf efficient
reasoning procedures can be used to implement our algorithm.},

We show that the local model semantics of a multi-context system is completely determined by the information that is obtained when simulating the information flow specified by the system, in such a way that a minimal amount of information is deduced at each step of the simulation.

The multi-context system framework implicitly presupposes that information flow is deterministic. In many natural situations, this is not a valid assumption. We propose an extension of the framework to account for non-determinism and provide an algorithm to efficiently compute the meaning of non-deterministic systems.},

Reiter's default logic. The logic provides a syntactical counterpart of Roelofsen and Serafini's information chain approach (IJCAI-05), yet has several
advantages: it is closer to standard ways of representing nonmonotonic inference and a number of
results from that area come `for free'; it is closer
to implementation, in particular the restriction to
logic programming gives us a computationally attractive framework; and it allows us to handle a
problem with the information chain approach related to skeptical reasoning.},

	Abstract = {This survey article discusses two basic issues that semantic theories of questions face. The first is how to conceptualise and formally represent the semantic content of
questions. This issue arises in particular because the standard truth-conditional notion of
meaning, which has been fruitful in the analysis of declarative statements, is not applicable
to questions. The second issue is how questions, when embedded in a declarative statement
(e.g., in Bill wonders who called) contribute to the truth-conditional content of that statement. Several ways in which these issues have been addressed in the literature are discussed
and compared.},

@unpublished{Cremers:19numerals,
	Abstract = {Modified numerals, such as at least three and more than five, are known to sometimes give rise to ignorance inferences. However, there is disagreement in the literature regarding the nature of these inferences, their context dependence, and differences between at least and more than. We present a series of experiments which sheds new light on these issues. Our results show that (a) the ignorance inferences of at least are more robust than those of more than, (b) the presence and strength of the ignorance inferences triggered by both at least and more than depends on the  QUD, and (c) whether ignorance inferences are detected in a given experimental setting depends partly on the task that participants are asked to perform (e.g., an acceptability task versus an inference task). We offer an Optimality Theoretic account of these findings. In particular, the task effect is captured by assuming that in performing an acceptability task, participants take the speaker's perspective in order to determine whether an expression is optimal given a certain epistemic state, while in performing an inference task they take the addressee's perspective in order to determine what the most likely epistemic state of the speaker is given a certain expression. To execute the latter task in a fully rational manner, participants have to perform higher-order reasoning about alternative expressions the speaker could have used. Under the assumption that participants do not always perform such higher-order reasoning but also often resort to so-called unidirectional optimization, the task effect finds a natural explanation. This also allows us to relate our finding to asymmetries between comprehension and production that have been found in language acquisition.},

Scientific investigation and explanation proceed in part through the posing and answering of questions, and human-computer interaction is often structured in terms of queries and answers. After going over some preliminaries we will focus on three lines of work on questions: one located at the intersection of philosophy of language and formal semantics, focusing on the semantics of what Belnap and Steel (1976) call elementary questions; a second located at the intersection of philosophy of language and philosophy of science, focusing on why-questions and the notion of explanation; and a third located at the intersection of philosophy of language and epistemology, focusing on embedded or indirect questions.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a semantics for declarative and interrogative complements and for so-called responsive verbs, like know and forget, which embed both kinds of complements. Following Groenendijk & Stokhof (1984), we pursue a uniform account in the sense that we take both kinds of complements to be of the same semantic type and we assume a single lexical entry for each responsive verb. This approach avoids a number of problems for non-uniform theories, such as the reductive theories of Karttunen (1977), Heim (1994), Lahiri (2002), Spector & Egr{\'{e}} (2015), among others, and the twin relations theory of George (2011). On the other hand, our account also addresses the main limitation of Groenendijk & Stokhof's (1984) proposal, which is that it is primarily designed to derive strongly exhaustive readings for interrogative complements. Our account is more flexible in that it straightforwardly derives non-exhaustive and intermediate exhaustive readings as well.},

referred to as a distributive ignorance inference (Roelofsen & Uegaki 2016). We
present two experiments examining the distributive ignorance inferences triggered
by two verbs, wonder and believe, with different types of complements and different
types of subjects.

The results of these experiments show that the distributive ignorance inferences
triggered by the two verbs pattern very much alike. We argue that the data are best
explained by an account that involves a strengthening mechanism which is sensitive
to the syntactic structure of the complement of the verbs involved and optionally
applies locally, as part of the semantic composition process.},

	Abstract = {Attitude predicates can be classified by the kinds of complements they can embed: declaratives, interrogatives or both. However, several authors have claimed that predicates like be certain can only embed interrogatives in specific environments. According to Mayr, these are exactly the environments that license negative polarity items (NPIs). In his analysis, both NPIs and embedded interrogatives are licensed by the same semantic strengthening procedure. If this is right, one would expect a correlation between acceptability of be certain whether and NPIs. The analysis also predicts a contrast between antecedents vs. consequents of conditionals and restrictors vs. scopes of universal quantifiers. This paper tests these predictions experimentally through an acceptability judgment task. We find that judgments for be certain whether do not correlate with judgments on NPIs, which suggests that be certain whether and NPIs are in fact licensed by different mechanisms.},

We point out that Hurford effects are found not only in disjunctive statements, but also in disjunctive questions. These cases are not covered by the standard accounts of Hurford phenomena, which assume a truth-conditional treatment of disjunction. We show that inquisitive semantics facilitates a unified explanation of Hurford phenomena in statements and questions. We also argue that Hurford effects provide an empirical handle on the subtle differences between inquisitive semantics and alternative semantics, providing insight into the notion of alternatives and the notion of meaning adopted in these two frameworks.},

The account aims to divide the labor between compositional semantics and conventions of use in a principled way. We argue that falling declaratives and polar interrogatives are unmarked sentence types. On our account, differences in their conventional discourse effects follow from independently motivated semantic differences combined with a single convention of use, which applies uniformly to both sentence types. As a result, the Fregean `illocutionary force operators' Assertion and Question become unnecessary. In contrast, we argue that rising declaratives and tag interrogatives are marked sentence types. On our account, their conventional discourse effects consist of the effects that are dictated by the basic convention of use that is common to all sentence types considered here, augmented with special effects that are systematically connected to their formal properties. Thus, a central feature of our approach is that it maintains a parallelism between unmarked and marked sentence types on the one hand, and basic and complex discourse effects on the other.},

	Abstract = {There is a prominent line of work in natural language semantics, rooted
in the work of Hamblin, in which the meaning of a sentence is not taken to be a
single proposition, but rather a set of propositions---a set of alternatives. This allows
for a more fine-grained view on meaning, which has led to improved analyses of a
wide range of linguistic phenomena. However, this approach also faces a number of
problems. We focus here on two of these, in our view the most fundamental ones. The
first has to do with how meanings are composed, i.e., with the type-theoretic operations
of function application and abstraction; the second has to do with how meanings are
compared, i.e., the notion of entailment. Our aim is to reconcile what we take to be
the essence of Hamblin's proposal with the more orthodox type-theoretic framework
rooted in the work of Montague in such a way that both the explanatory utility of
the former and the solid formal foundations of the latter are preserved. Our proposal
builds on insights from recent work on inquisitive semantics, and it also contributes to
the further development of this framework by specifying how the inquisitive meaning
of a sentence may be built up compositionally.},

	Abstract = {Responsive verbs like know embed both declarative and interrogative
complements. Standard accounts of such verbs are reductive: they assume that
whether an individual stands in a knowledge-wh relation to a question is determined
by whether she stands in a knowledge-that relation to some answer to the question. George (2013) observed that knowledge-wh, however, not only depends on
knowledge-that but also on false belief---a fact that reductive accounts can't capture.
We develop an account that is not reductive but uniform: it assumes a single entry
for interrogative-embedding and declarative-embedding uses of a responsive verb.
The key insight that allows us to capture the false-belief dependency of knowledgewh is that verbs like know are sensitive to both true and false answers to the
embedded question. Formally, this is achieved through a novel, fine-grained way
of representing the meaning of a clausal complement in terms of so-called truthful
resolutions. The resulting analysis gives us a unifying perspective, under which
false-answer sensitivity comes out as a general characteristic common to all levels
of exhaustivity.},

This paper develops a semantic framework for the analysis of this kind of
information exchange. Building on earlier work in inquisitive semantics,
it introduces a notion of meaning that captures informative, inquisitive,

focus is on conditionals, which are the only kind of sentences in a propositional language that introduce non-trivial suppositional content.},

	Abstract = {Information exchange can be seen as a dynamic process of raising and resolving issues. The goal of this paper is to provide a logical framework to model and reason about this process. We develop an inquisitive dynamic epistemic logic (IDEL), which enriches the standard framework of dynamic epistemic logic (DEL), incorporating insights from recent work on inquisitive semantics. At a static level, IDEL does not only allow us to model the information available to a set of agents, like standard epistemic logic, but also the issues that the agents entertain. At a dynamic level, IDEL does not only allow us to model the effects of communicative actions that provide new information, like standard DEL, but also the effects of actions that raise new issues. Thus, IDEL provides the fundamental tools needed to analyze information exchange as a dynamic process of raising and resolving issues.},

	Abstract = {Hamblin (1973) proposed an extension of the basic type-theoretic framework used in formal
semantics, rooted in Montague (1970, 1973). In Hamblin's framework, which has come to
be referred to as alternative semantics, the meaning of a sentence is not taken to be a single
proposition, but rather a set of propositions---a set of alternatives. This allows for a more
fine-grained view on meaning, which has led to improved analyses of a wide range of linguistic
phenomena. However, it also faces a number of problems. We focus here on two of these, in
our view the most fundamental ones. The first has to do with how meanings are composed,
i.e., with the type-theoretic operations of function application and abstraction; the second has
to do with how meanings are compared, i.e., the notion of entailment. Our aim is to reconcile
what we take to be the essence of Hamblin's proposal with the more orthodox type-theoretic
framework rooted in Montague's work, in such a way that the solid formal foundations of the
latter are preserved and the observed problems for alternative semantics are overcome. Our
proposal builds on insights from recent work on inquisitive semantics (Ciardelli et al., 2013),
and it also further advances this line of work, specifying how the inquisitive meaning of a
sentence, as well as the set of alternatives that it introduces, may be built up compositionally.},

that understanding the distribution and interpretation of polarity particles requires a characterization of declaratives and interrogatives that captures a series of challenging similarities and differences across these two sentence types. To meet this challenge we combine and extend insights
from inquisitive semantics, dynamic semantics, and commitment-based models of discourse. We
then provide a full account of the English data that leads to a typology of polarity particles and a
series of crosslinguistic predictions. These predictions are checked against data from Romanian,
Hungarian, French, and German, languages that contrast with English in that they have ternary polarity particle systems, and contrast with one another in further subtle way.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an experiment that is designed to quantify the negativity of sentences with different types of negative operators (n-words like never and downward entailing operators like rarely) in different syntactic positions (adverb, subject, and direct object). In the experiment, participants were provided with a minimal context, then asked to choose one tag-question out of two; one of questions had a positive tag and the other had a negative tag. Clearly positive sentences (i.e., sentences without any negative operators) and clearly negative sentences (i.e., sentences with overt sentential negation and no other relevant operators present) were used as controls. The relative frequency of positive and negative tags was then taken as a measure of the sentential negativity of each experimental item. Our main finding is that sentential negativity is a graded notion, sensitive to both semantic and syntactic factors. With respect to semantics, we find that n-words contribute more negativity than downward entailing operators, confirming the logical distinction between anti-additivity and downward entailment identified in the previous semantic literature on NPI licensing. With respect to syntactic position, we find that negative items in subject or adverbial position contribute more negativity than negative items in direct object position.},

final pitch contour. Alternative questions are canonically pronounced
with a final fall and with pitch accents on all disjuncts, while disjunctive polar questions are canonically pronounced with a final rise and
generally without pitch accents on every disjunct. This article presents
an experiment investigating the importance of these prosodic features
in disambiguation. The experiment shows that the final contour is the
most informative prosodic feature. Accentual characteristics also play
a significant role, but, contrary to what is often assumed in the literature, cannot force an alternative question interpretation or a polar
question interpretation on their own. Several theories of disjunctive
questions are discussed in the light of these experimental results.},

@article{Roelofsen:13,
	Abstract = {In classical logic, the proposition expressed by a sentence is construed as a set of possible worlds, capturing the informative content of the sentence. However, sentences in natural language are not only used to provide information, but also to request information. Thus, natural language semantics requires a logical framework whose notion of meaning does not only embody informative content, but also inquisitive content. This paper develops the algebraic foundations for such a framework. We argue that propositions, in order to embody both informative and inquisitive content in a satisfactory way, should be defined as non-empty, downward closed sets of possibilities, where each possibility in turn is a set of possible worlds. We define a natural entailment order over such propositions, capturing when one proposition is at least as informative and inquisitive as another, and we show that this entailment order gives rise to a complete Heyting algebra, with meet, join, and relative pseudo-complement operators. Just as in classical logic, these semantic operators are then associated with the logical constants in a first-order language. We explore the logical properties of the resulting system and discuss its significance for natural language semantics. We show that the system essentially coincides with the simplest and most well-understood existing implementation of inquisitive semantics, and that its treatment of disjunction and existentials also concurs with recent work in alternative semantics. Thus, our algebraic considerations do not lead to a wholly new treatment of the logical constants, but rather provide more solid foundations for some of the existing proposals.},

	Abstract = {Concealed questions are determiner phrases that are naturally paraphrased as embedded questions (e.g., John knows the capital of Italy ≈ John knows what the capital of Italy is). This paper offers a novel account of the interpretation of concealed questions, which assumes that an entity-denoting expression α may be type-shifted into an expression ?z.P(α), where P is a contextually determined property, and z ranges over a contextually determined domain of individual concepts. Different resolutions of P and the domain of z yield a wide range of concealed question interpretations, some of which were not noted previously. On the other hand, principled constraints on the resolution process prevent overgeneration.},

@inproceedings{RoelofsenGool:10,
	Abstract = {This paper examines how intonation affects the interpretation of disjunctive questions. The semantic effect
of a question is taken to be three-fold. First, it raises an issue. In the tradition of inquisitive semantics, we
model this by assuming that a question proposes several possible updates of the common ground (several
possibilities for short) and invites other participants to help establish at least one of these updates. But apart
from raising an issue, a question may also highlight and/or suggest certain possibilities, and intonation
determines to a large extent which possibilities are highlighted/suggested. We will introduce a compositional version of inquisitive semantics, and extend this framework in order to capture the highlighting- and suggestion potential of sentences. This will lead to a systematic account of the answerhood conditions and
implications of disjunctive questions with different intonation patterns.},

semantics. After that, we present a formal definition of the semantics,
introduce the semantic notions of inquisitiveness and informativeness,
and define the semantic categories of questions, assertions, and hybrid
sentences.
The focus of the paper will be on the logical pragmatical notions that
the semantics gives rise to. We introduce and motivate inquisitive versions of principles of cooperation, which direct a conversation towards
enhancement of the common ground. We define a notion of compliance,
which judges relatedness of one utterance to another, and a notion of homogeneity, which enables quantitative comparison of compliant moves.
We end the paper with an illustration of the cooperative way in which
implicatures are established, or cancelled, in inquisitive pragmatics.},
