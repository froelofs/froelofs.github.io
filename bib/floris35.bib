  abstract={This paper evaluates empirical methods for detecting the focus-sensitivity of clause-embedding predicates, with the objective of making them applicable to predicates within and across languages. Our positive proposal is a test based on a combination of inferential judgments and truth-value judgments. We compare this method with three alternatives: one based on truth-value judgments alone; another based on judgments of coherence or contradiction; and a third one based on inferential judgments alone. We conclude that our combined test is more successful than its alternatives in terms of cross-linguistic uniformity (i.e., it is applicable to different languages with as few language-specific elements involved as possible) and item generalizability (i.e., there is a clear recipe for how to carry out the test for any clause-embedding predicate).},

  abstract={The importance of hearing parents of deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) children learning sign language is well documented. However, parents face many challenges in this learning process. This study investigates the experiences of Dutch hearing parents learning Dutch Sign Language (NGT) or Sign-supported Dutch through semi-structured interviews with 21 parents and 6 NGT teachers. The interviews explored parents’ and teachers’ perspectives on parental sign language courses, additional learning materials, and the challenges parents face in learning sign language. The findings highlight the value of DHH teachers and home-based initial courses, as well as the importance of courses aligning with the child’s developmental stage and extending beyond vocabulary level. Both parents and teachers appreciated learning materials that could be used together by parent and child but expressed a need for additional and more elaborate resources. Common challenges included language-specific difficulties, such as mastering sign order and adapting to a visual language, and external barriers, such as difficulties accessing courses and conflicting expert advice regarding the use of sign language. These findings underscore the need for more accessible courses, longer-duration support, and greater consistency among professionals in their advice. This would better support hearing parents in effectively learning sign language and ensuring their DHH children have full access to language from an early age.},

  pages={1--9},
  abstract={Motion capture systems designed for sign language must meet unique demands: capturing highly detailed hand, face, and body movements while preserving the linguistic and expressive integrity of the performance. This paper documents the iterative development of a marker-based motion capture setup tailored specifically for sign language data collection. Through a combination of hardware configuration, camera placement strategies, and workflow optimizations, we demonstrate how to balance tracking precision with signer comfort and recording efficiency. Our system enables the high-throughput capture of individual signs—up to 500 per day—without relying on post-processing, thereby preserving the authenticity of the performance.
Beyond presenting the workflow, this paper focuses on sharing insights gained throughout the development process, including the technical and practical challenges of working with a marker-based system. We discuss how issues such as marker size, facial tracking comfort, and infrared interference were addressed through iterative setup design. Currently, the system is optimized for recording isolated signs from a single, front-facing signer, which simplifies setup but limits the range of linguistic data that can be collected. Future work will focus on supporting multi-signer interactions, introducing new challenges in occlusion, camera coverage, and tracking fidelity.},

The perspectives of DHH users and interpreters are investigated using the User Acceptance Model (TAM) and the extended, more holistic version, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) in combination with on-site user testing and evaluation. Results show that interpreters preferred AR VRI over VRI. While DHH users recognized the potential of future advancements, they considered current technology inadequate. The results of interactive unscripted testing in this study contrasted outcomes from previously scripted controlled experiments. Suggestions for future research include examination of tailored hardware for DHH users, studying specific use cases, and investigating the ethical concerns of this technology.},

We present findings from two studies investigating these forms in Catalan Sign Language (LSC). The first study is based on elicitation with three LSC consultants, while the second is an online experiment which collected judgments from 50 deaf LSC signers. Our research reveals that LSC quex-indefinites may be either identical to or resemble question words and identifies the semantic categories and environments that allow them. Specifically, quex-indefinites in LSC are possible in the categories of person, quantity, cause, and time. The licensing environments include polar questions, antecedents of conditionals, positive episodic sentences, and some modal environments. This study provides the first description of quex-indefinites in a sign language, contributing to the understanding of the affinity between indefinite and interrogative pronouns.},

We introduce the NGT200 dataset, a novel spatio-temporal multi-view benchmark, establishing MV-ISR as distinct from single-view ISR (SV-ISR).

showcase the dataset utility by presenting a simple method for generating handshape annotations directly from
3D-LEX. We produce handshape labels for 1,000 signs from American Sign Language and evaluate the labels in a
sign recognition task. The labels enhance gloss recognition accuracy by 5% over using no handshape annotations,

synsets in the Multilingual Sign Language Wordnet. Additionally, we are recording extra video data: we make
multiple videos of the same sign, taken from different angles, and videos with non-manual expressions.
Furthermore, we are collecting motion capture data, for improved (automatic) sign language recognition and
production in the future. In this paper, we describe how we proceed, the decisions that have been made so far, and

signer to control the system through simple gestures (recognized using computer vision) to (i) prompt the display
of the next lexical entry, (ii) start a new recording, and (iii) approve/disapprove a recording. This capability allows
a signer to record between 60 to 120 signs per hour, without the need for any assisting staff to be present. The
approved recordings immediately become visible in the signCollect database, so that other members of the team can
add metadata. With feedback from workshop participants we intend to further optimize the signCollect platform and

  abstract = {Communication between healthcare professionals and deaf patients has been particularly challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have explored the possibility to automatically translate phrases that are frequently used in the diagnosis and treatment of hospital patients, in particular phrases related to COVID-19, from Dutch or English to Dutch Sign Language (NGT). The prototype system we developed displays translations either by means of pre-recorded videos featuring a deaf human signer (for a limited number of sentences) or by means of animations featuring a computer-generated signing avatar (for a larger, though still restricted number of sentences). We evaluated the comprehensibility of the signing avatar, as compared to the human signer. We found that, while individual signs are recognized correctly when signed by the avatar almost as frequently as when signed by a human, sentence comprehension rates and clarity scores for the avatar are substantially lower than for the human signer. We identify a number of concrete limitations of the JAsigning avatar engine that underlies our system. Namely, the engine currently does not offer sufficient control over mouth shapes, the relative speed and intensity of signs in a sentence (prosody), and transitions between signs. These limitations need to be overcome in future work for the engine to become usable in practice.},

Several recent projects have employed a TrueDepth camera to make such measurements. The present paper investigates how reliable this technique is. In particular, we consider the extent to which the obtained measurements are affected by the angle between the camera and the face. Overall, we find that there are generally significant, and often rather substantial differences between measurements from different angles. However, when the measured facial features are highly activated, measurements from different angles are generally strongly correlated.}

We find that in some cases headshake expresses negation, as ex- pected, but in other cases it fulfils another function, namely, it is part of a sentence-final phrase either expressing uncertainty or signalling a request for a response from the ad- dressee, or possibly both at the same time. We further observe that each question form has a distinct ‘bias profile’, indicating a certain combination of prior expectations and contextual evidence. Besides these empirical findings, our study also makes a method- ological contribution: our experimental design could be used in future work to identify polar question forms with different bias profiles in sign languages other than NGT, as well as visual cues accompanying polar questions with different bias profiles in spoken languages.},

To deal with an incomplete ground truth, we introduce the concept of distractors: signs which are similar to the target sign according to a given distance measure.

We detect landmarks with Mediapipe and extract linguistically relevant features from them, including handshape, orientation, location, and movement.

Dynamic inquisitive semantics: Anaphora and questions. Sinn und Bedeutung 23. 365–382). Within this framework, we develop a compositional treatment of wh-questions whose basic premise is that a wh-phrase introduces a discourse referent u, just like non-interrogative indefinites do, and requires the presence of an operator in the left periphery of the clause which requests a witness for u, i.e., it raises an issue whose resolution requires identifying at least one individual that has all the properties ascribed to u. In previous work, it has been argued that a dynamic semantic analysis of questions is needed to account for anaphora with wh-antecedents and for certain kinds of intervention effects (Haida, Andreas. 2007. The indefiniteness and focusing of wh-words. Berlin: Humboldt University PhD thesis). Here, we further develop the general approach and argue that it has several additional benefits. Namely, it allows for a uniform treatment of single-wh and multiple-wh questions, it derives mention-some and mention-all readings in a principled way, as well as an often neglected partial mention-some reading in multiple-wh questions, it can capture certain constraints on the availability of mention-some readings, and the effects of number marking on which-phrases across single-wh and multiple-wh questions.},

   and show that we can extend inquisitive semantics in a principled way using independently motivated ingredients to derive such wide-scope
  readings that expect pair-list answers for various quantifiers. 
  We also identify factors that contribute to their gradient acceptability.}

It has been claimed in the literature (e.g., Haida 2007) that, across languages, quexistentials are (a) always focused on their interrogative interpretation and (b) never focused on their existential interpretation. We refer to this as the quexistential-focus biconditional. The article makes two contributions. The first is that we offer a possible explanation for one direction of the biconditional: the fact that quexistentials are generally contrastively focused on their interrogative use. We argue that this should be seen as a particular instance of an even more general fact—namely, that interrogative words (quexistential or not) are always contrastively focused—and propose an account for this fact. The second contribution of the article concerns the other direction of the biconditional. We present evidence that, at least at face value, suggests that focus on a quexistential does not necessarily preclude an existential interpretation. Specifically, we show that it is possible for Dutch wat to be interpreted existentially even when it is focused. We attempt to explain this phenomenon.}",

  abstract = {Modified numerals, such as at least three and more than five, are known to sometimes give rise to ignorance inferences. However, there is disagreement in the literature regarding the nature of these inferences, their context dependence, and differences between at least and more than. We present a series of experiments which sheds new light on these issues. Our results show that (a) the ignorance inferences of at least are more robust than those of more than, (b) the presence and strength of the ignorance inferences triggered by both at least and more than depends on the question under discussion (QUD), and (c) whether ignorance inferences are detected in a given experimental setting depends partly on the task that participants are asked to perform (e.g., an acceptability task versus an inference task). We offer an Optimality Theoretic account of these findings. In particular, the task effect is captured by assuming that in performing an acceptability task, participants take the speaker’s perspective in order to determine whether an expression is optimal given a certain epistemic state, while in performing an inference task they take the addressee’s perspective in order to determine what the most likely epistemic state of the speaker is given a certain expression. To execute the latter task in a fully rational manner, participants have to perform higher-order reasoning about alternative expressions the speaker could have used. Under the assumption that participants do not always perform such higher-order reasoning but also often resort to so-called unidirectional optimization, the task effect finds a natural explanation. This also allows us to relate our finding to asymmetries between comprehension and production that have been found in language acquisition.},

view wh-words as existential quantifiers or as expressions introducing a
quantificational domain, but rather as indeterminate referential expressions
(Dotlačil and Roelofsen 2019). The proposal is programmatic in nature,
and several aspects of it remain to be worked out in greater detail. I
argue, however, that it has several potential benefits, including a principled
account of weak and strong question interpretations, a uniform analysis of
single-wh and multiple-wh questions, and an account of the typologically
widespread similarity between interrogative and indefinite pronouns which,
unlike previous approaches, can explain the observation that if a language
contains interrogative and indefinite pronouns which are similar in form but
non-identical (e.g., where and somewhere), the indefinite pronouns are always
morphologically more complex than the interrogative pronouns, and never
the other way around (Haspelmath 1997). The tentative proposal is that an
interrogative pronoun involves complete indeterminacy in the sense that it
does not only leave open what its referential value is but also whether it
has a referential value at all. For instance, where is completely indeterminate,
permitting lack of a referential value. The ‘some’ in somewhere eliminates this
possibility and thereby exerts existential force.},

Reiter's default logic. The logic provides a syntactical counterpart of Roelofsen and Serafini's information chain approach (IJCAI-05), yet has several
advantages: it is closer to standard ways of representing nonmonotonic inference and a number of
results from that area come `for free'; it is closer
to implementation, in particular the restriction to
logic programming gives us a computationally attractive framework; and it allows us to handle a
problem with the information chain approach related to skeptical reasoning.},

to questions. The second issue is how questions, when embedded in a declarative statement
(e.g., in Bill wonders who called) contribute to the truth-conditional content of that statement. Several ways in which these issues have been addressed in the literature are discussed

This approach avoids a number of problems for non-uniform theories, such as the reductive theories of Karttunen (1977), Heim (1994), Lahiri (2002), Spector & Egr{\'{e}} (2015), among others, and the twin relations theory of George (2011). On the other hand, our account also addresses the main limitation of Groenendijk & Stokhof's (1984) proposal, which is that it is primarily designed to derive strongly exhaustive readings for interrogative complements. Our account is more flexible in that it straightforwardly derives non-exhaustive and intermediate exhaustive readings as well.},

vase implies that Mary still considers all disjuncts possible. This inference has been
referred to as a distributive ignorance inference (Roelofsen & Uegaki 2016). We
present two experiments examining the distributive ignorance inferences triggered
by two verbs, wonder and believe, with different types of complements and different
types of subjects.

The results of these experiments show that the distributive ignorance inferences
triggered by the two verbs pattern very much alike. We argue that the data are best
explained by an account that involves a strengthening mechanism which is sensitive
to the syntactic structure of the complement of the verbs involved and optionally
applies locally, as part of the semantic composition process.},

	abstract = {Attitude predicates can be classified by the kinds of complements they can embed: declaratives, interrogatives or both. However, several authors have claimed that predicates like be certain can only embed interrogatives in specific environments. According to Mayr, these are exactly the environments that license negative polarity items (NPIs). In his analysis, both NPIs and embedded interrogatives are licensed by the same semantic strengthening procedure. If this is right, one would expect a correlation between acceptability of be certain whether and NPIs. The analysis also predicts a contrast between antecedents vs. consequents of conditionals and restrictors vs. scopes of universal quantifiers. This paper tests these predictions experimentally through an acceptability judgment task. We find that judgments for be certain whether do not correlate with judgments on NPIs, which suggests that be certain whether and NPIs are in fact licensed by different mechanisms.},

These cases are not covered by the standard accounts of Hurford phenomena, which assume a truth-conditional treatment of disjunction. We show that inquisitive semantics facilitates a unified explanation of Hurford phenomena in statements and questions.

The account aims to divide the labor between compositional semantics and conventions of use in a principled way. We argue that falling declaratives and polar interrogatives are unmarked sentence types. On our account, differences in their conventional discourse effects follow from independently motivated semantic differences combined with a single convention of use, which applies uniformly to both sentence types. As a result, the Fregean `illocutionary force operators' Assertion and Question become unnecessary. In contrast, we argue that rising declaratives and tag interrogatives are marked sentence types. On our account, their conventional discourse effects consist of the effects that are dictated by the basic convention of use that is common to all sentence types considered here, augmented with special effects that are systematically connected to their formal properties. Thus, a central feature of our approach is that it maintains a parallelism between unmarked and marked sentence types on the one hand, and basic and complex discourse effects on the other.},

	abstract = {There is a prominent line of work in natural language semantics, rooted
in the work of Hamblin, in which the meaning of a sentence is not taken to be a
single proposition, but rather a set of propositions---a set of alternatives. This allows
for a more fine-grained view on meaning, which has led to improved analyses of a
wide range of linguistic phenomena. However, this approach also faces a number of
problems. We focus here on two of these, in our view the most fundamental ones. The
first has to do with how meanings are composed, i.e., with the type-theoretic operations
of function application and abstraction; the second has to do with how meanings are
compared, i.e., the notion of entailment. Our aim is to reconcile what we take to be
the essence of Hamblin's proposal with the more orthodox type-theoretic framework
rooted in the work of Montague in such a way that both the explanatory utility of
the former and the solid formal foundations of the latter are preserved. Our proposal
builds on insights from recent work on inquisitive semantics, and it also contributes to
the further development of this framework by specifying how the inquisitive meaning
of a sentence may be built up compositionally.},

their complement but not whether-questions. For instance, it is felicitous to say
It is surprising who Bill had invited but not to say It is surprising whether Bill had
invited his wife. We refer to this contrast as the *whether puzzle. We propose an
account which crucially rests on the assumption that the relevant kind of verbs are
sensitive to the semantic objects that their complement clause brings into salience,
rather than just its truth/resolution conditions. It has been argued in previous work
that the semantic objects that matrix questions bring into salience are important
to understand the role of such questions in discourse. The present paper is, to the
best of our knowledge, the first to argue that this aspect of meaning is also crucial
for understanding the role of embedded questions in grammar.},

	abstract = {Responsive verbs like know embed both declarative and interrogative
complements. Standard accounts of such verbs are reductive: they assume that
whether an individual stands in a knowledge-wh relation to a question is determined
by whether she stands in a knowledge-that relation to some answer to the question. George (2013) observed that knowledge-wh, however, not only depends on
knowledge-that but also on false belief---a fact that reductive accounts can't capture.
We develop an account that is not reductive but uniform: it assumes a single entry
for interrogative-embedding and declarative-embedding uses of a responsive verb.
The key insight that allows us to capture the false-belief dependency of knowledgewh is that verbs like know are sensitive to both true and false answers to the
embedded question. Formally, this is achieved through a novel, fine-grained way
of representing the meaning of a clausal complement in terms of so-called truthful
resolutions. The resulting analysis gives us a unifying perspective, under which
false-answer sensitivity comes out as a general characteristic common to all levels
of exhaustivity.},

but it is also often done in a less direct way, as in If Pete plays the piano,
will Susan sing? No, if Pete plays the piano, Susan won't sing. In the latter type of exchange, both participants make a certain supposition, and
exchange information under the assumption that this supposition holds.
This paper develops a semantic framework for the analysis of this kind of
information exchange. Building on earlier work in inquisitive semantics,
it introduces a notion of meaning that captures informative, inquisitive,
and suppositional content, and discusses how such meanings may be assigned in a natural way to sentences in a propositional language. The
focus is on conditionals, which are the only kind of sentences in a propositional language that introduce non-trivial suppositional content.},

At a static level, IDEL does not only allow us to model the information available to a set of agents, like standard epistemic logic, but also the issues that the agents entertain. At a dynamic level, IDEL does not only allow us to model the effects of communicative actions that provide new information, like standard DEL, but also the effects of actions that raise new issues. Thus, IDEL provides the fundamental tools needed to analyze information exchange as a dynamic process of raising and resolving issues.},

then provide a full account of the English data that leads to a typology of polarity particles and a
series of crosslinguistic predictions. These predictions are checked against data from Romanian,

In the experiment, participants were provided with a minimal context, then asked to choose one tag-question out of two; one of questions had a positive tag and the other had a negative tag. Clearly positive sentences (i.e., sentences without any negative operators) and clearly negative sentences (i.e., sentences with overt sentential negation and no other relevant operators present) were used as controls. The relative frequency of positive and negative tags was then taken as a measure of the sentential negativity of each experimental item. Our main finding is that sentential negativity is a graded notion, sensitive to both semantic and syntactic factors. With respect to semantics, we find that n-words contribute more negativity than downward entailing operators, confirming the logical distinction between anti-additivity and downward entailment identified in the previous semantic literature on NPI licensing. With respect to syntactic position, we find that negative items in subject or adverbial position contribute more negativity than negative items in direct object position.},

@article{Roelofsen:13,
	abstract = {In classical logic, the proposition expressed by a sentence is construed as a set of possible worlds, capturing the informative content of the sentence. However, sentences in natural language are not only used to provide information, but also to request information. Thus, natural language semantics requires a logical framework whose notion of meaning does not only embody informative content, but also inquisitive content. This paper develops the algebraic foundations for such a framework. We argue that propositions, in order to embody both informative and inquisitive content in a satisfactory way, should be defined as non-empty, downward closed sets of possibilities, where each possibility in turn is a set of possible worlds. We define a natural entailment order over such propositions, capturing when one proposition is at least as informative and inquisitive as another, and we show that this entailment order gives rise to a complete Heyting algebra, with meet, join, and relative pseudo-complement operators. Just as in classical logic, these semantic operators are then associated with the logical constants in a first-order language. We explore the logical properties of the resulting system and discuss its significance for natural language semantics. We show that the system essentially coincides with the simplest and most well-understood existing implementation of inquisitive semantics, and that its treatment of disjunction and existentials also concurs with recent work in alternative semantics. Thus, our algebraic considerations do not lead to a wholly new treatment of the logical constants, but rather provide more solid foundations for some of the existing proposals.},

Different resolutions of P and the domain of z yield a wide range of concealed question interpretations, some of which were not noted previously.

	abstract = {This paper examines how intonation affects the interpretation of disjunctive questions. The semantic effect
of a question is taken to be three-fold. First, it raises an issue. In the tradition of inquisitive semantics, we
model this by assuming that a question proposes several possible updates of the common ground (several
possibilities for short) and invites other participants to help establish at least one of these updates. But apart
from raising an issue, a question may also highlight and/or suggest certain possibilities, and intonation
determines to a large extent which possibilities are highlighted/suggested. We will introduce a compositional version of inquisitive semantics, and extend this framework in order to capture the highlighting- and suggestion potential of sentences. This will lead to a systematic account of the answerhood conditions and
implications of disjunctive questions with different intonation patterns.},
